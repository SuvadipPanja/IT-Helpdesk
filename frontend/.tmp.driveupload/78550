## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Vague Descriptions**
"Computer broken" → No actionable information

✅ **Specific Descriptions**
"Computer shows blue screen with STOP error 0x0000007B after Windows update"

---

❌ **Wrong Priority**
Marking "Keyboard sticky key not working" as Critical

✅ **Correct Priority**
Marking actual business-stopping issues as Critical

---

❌ **Multiple Issues in One Ticket**
"My email is slow AND my computer won't print AND I need Office installed"

✅ **One Issue Per Ticket**
Create separate tickets for each distinct issue

---

❌ **No Follow-Up**
Creating ticket then never responding to engineer's questions

✅ **Active Participation**
Responding same day to questions and testing solutions

## Example: Perfect Ticket

- Not time-critical

**Real Examples:**
✅ "Computer running very slowly"
✅ "Printer occasionally jamming"
✅ "Cannot access one specific file"
✅ "Software feature behaving oddly"
✅ "Mouse double-clicking randomly"

**What Happens:**
1. Assigned during business hours
2. Engineer reviews within 4 hours
3. Scheduled for resolution within 24 hours
4. Updates when significant progress made
5. May be batched with similar issues
6. Auto-escalates if not resolved in 24h

**Warning Threshold:**
At 19.2 hours (80%), warning sent to engineer.

---

### 🟢 Low Priority

**SLA Targets:**
- ⏱️ **First Response:** 8 hours
- ✅ **Resolution:** 48 hours (2 business days)
- 🚨 **Auto-Escalation:** No (optional)

**When to Use:**
- Minor annoyance
- Enhancement request
- Information/how-to question
- Training request
- Nice-to-have improvement
- Cosmetic issue

**Real Examples:**
✅ "Request to install optional software"
✅ "How do I use feature X?"
✅ "Button text is misspelled"
✅ "Suggestion: Add dark mode"
✅ "Training on Excel formulas"

**What Happens:**
1. Queued in normal workflow
2. Engineer reviews when capacity available
3. May be scheduled for batch processing
4. Updates at key milestones only
5. No automatic escalation
6. May be deferred if higher priorities arise

**Note:** Low priority doesn't mean unimportant - just not urgent.

## SLA Calculation

### Business Hours (Default)

**Configuration:**
- Monday - Friday: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM IST
- Weekends: **Excluded**
- Holidays: **Excluded**

**How Timer Works:**
- ⏸️ Pauses at 6:00 PM
- ⏸️ Pauses on weekends
- ⏸️ Pauses on holidays
- ▶️ Resumes next business day at 9:00 AM

**Example:**
\`\`\`
High Priority Ticket (8-hour SLA)

Created: Friday 3:00 PM
Friday 3 PM - 6 PM = 3 hours
[Weekend - Timer paused]
Monday 9 AM - 2 PM = 5 hours
Total: 8 business hours
Due: Monday 2:00 PM
\`\`\`

### Pending Status Pause

**Important:** When ticket status is "Pending" (waiting for your response), SLA timer **PAUSES**.

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Ticket created: Monday 10:00 AM
Status: In Progress (SLA counting)
12:00 PM: Engineer asks question, changes to "Pending"
[SLA PAUSED for 6 hours while you're researching]
6:00 PM: You respond, status back to "In Progress"
[SLA RESUMES counting]
\`\`\`

**Why:** Fair for both sides - engineer can't resolve without your input.

## Warning System

### 80% Warning Threshold

When ticket reaches 80% of SLA time:

**Automatic Actions:**
1. ⚠️ Yellow warning badge on ticket
2. 📧 Email to assigned engineer
3. 🔔 Dashboard notification
4. 📊 Logged in analytics

**For 8-hour SLA:**
- 0-6.4h: Green (safe)
- 6.4-8h: Yellow (warning)
- 8h+: Red (breach)

**Email Example:**
\`\`\`
Subject: ⚠️ SLA Warning - Ticket #TKT-001234

Your ticket is approaching SLA deadline!

Ticket: #TKT-001234
Priority: High
Elapsed: 6.8 / 8.0 hours (85%)
Remaining: 1.2 hours
Due: Today 3:00 PM IST

Action Required: Provide status update or escalate if blocked.
\`\`\`

## SLA Breach & Escalation

### When SLA Expires

At 100% of SLA time (resolution target):

**Automatic Actions:**
1. 🔴 Status changed to "Escalated"
2. 📧 Emails sent to:
   - Assigned engineer
   - Ticket requester
   - Department manager
   - System administrators
3. 👨‍💼 Ticket assigned to manager
4. 📊 Breach logged in reports
5. ⚡ Priority may be increased

**Email Example:**
\`\`\`
Subject: 🔴 SLA BREACH - Ticket #TKT-001234

ALERT: This ticket has exceeded its SLA target!

Ticket: #TKT-001234
Priority: High
Status: 105% (8.4 / 8.0 hours)
Overdue: 24 minutes

Action: Escalated to management for review.
\`\`\`

### Auto-Escalation Settings

**Enabled By Default For:**
- 🔴 Critical: Always
- 🟠 High: Always
- 🟡 Medium: Always
- 🟢 Low: No (admin can enable)

**Manager Actions After Escalation:**
- Review ticket details
- Reassign to different engineer
- Provide additional resources
- Increase priority if needed
- Communicate directly with requester

## Priority Decision Tree

**Ask yourself these questions:**

**1. Is the business completely stopped?**
- YES → 🔴 **Critical**
- NO → Continue

**2. Are multiple people unable to work?**
- YES → 🟠 **High**
- NO → Continue

**3. Is your work significantly impacted?**
- YES → 🟡 **Medium**
- NO → 🟢 **Low**

## Changing Priority

### Who Can Change:
- ✅ Administrators (always)
- ✅ Managers (always)
- ✅ Engineers (for assigned tickets)
- ❌ Regular users (cannot change directly)

### How to Request Change:

If you need priority changed:

1. Add comment to ticket
2. Explain business justification
3. Tag manager: @manager
4. Wait for approval

**Example Comment:**
\`\`\`
@manager This issue is now affecting 15 users in accounting who cannot process invoices. Recommend changing from Medium to High priority as it's blocking end-of-month close.
\`\`\`

### Priority Change Impact:
- ⏰ SLA timer recalculates
- 📧 New notifications sent
- 👨‍💼 May trigger reassignment
- 📊 Logged in ticket activity

## Common Questions

**Q: My Low priority ticket hasn't been touched in 3 days. Why?**
A: Low priority has 48-hour SLA. After that, it auto-escalates to manager who will review workload and reprioritize if needed.

**Q: Can I have multiple Critical tickets at once?**
A: Yes, but each should truly be critical. False Critical tickets delay real emergencies and hurt everyone.

**Q: What if I disagree with assigned priority?**
A: Comment on ticket explaining business impact. Manager will review and adjust if justified.

**Q: Does SLA count weekends?**
A: By default no (business hours only). Admin can configure 24/7 mode if your organization operates continuously.

**Q: What happens if engineer is sick/on vacation?**
A: Ticket will be reassigned to another engineer. SLA continues counting to ensure timely resolution.

**Q: Can I get SLA extended?**
A: Not directly. If you need more time to provide information, engineer changes status to "Pending" which pauses SLA.

## Best Practices

### For Users:

✅ **Choose Honestly:** Base priority on actual business impact
✅ **Provide Context:** Explain why you chose that priority
✅ **Update When Changes:** If situation worsens, add comment
✅ **Respond Quickly:** "Pending" status pauses SLA but delays resolution
✅ **Trust the Process:** Engineers and managers will adjust if needed

### For Engineers:

✅ **Acknowledge Fast:** Even if can't resolve immediately, respond
✅ **Set Expectations:** Tell requester realistic timeframe
✅ **Use Pending Wisely:** Only when truly waiting for customer
✅ **Update Regularly:** Especially on High/Critical tickets
✅ **Escalate Proactively:** If blocked, don't wait for SLA breach

### For Managers:

✅ **Monitor Daily:** Check SLA dashboard every morning
✅ **Review Breaches:** Understand why they happened
✅ **Adjust Targets:** If many breaches, SLA targets may be unrealistic
✅ **Train Team:** Patterns in breaches indicate training opportunities
✅ **Celebrate Wins:** Acknowledge when team meets SLA consistently

**Next Status:** Back to "In Progress" with renewed focus

## Status Flow Diagram

**Typical Happy Path:**
\`\`\`
Open → Assigned → In Progress → Resolved → Closed
\`\`\`

**With Information Needed:**
\`\`\`
Open → Assigned → In Progress → Pending → In Progress → Resolved → Closed
\`\`\`

**With SLA Breach:**
\`\`\`
Open → Assigned → In Progress → Escalated → In Progress → Resolved → Closed
\`\`\`

**Issue Resurfaces:**
\`\`\`
Closed → Reopened (becomes Open) → Assigned → In Progress → Resolved → Closed
\`\`\`

## Time in Each Status

**Configure in:** Profile → Notifications

## Common Questions

**Q: My ticket has been "In Progress" for 2 days. Is that normal?**
A: Depends on priority and complexity. Check comments for updates. If no updates and approaching SLA, it will auto-escalate.

**Q: What's the difference between "Resolved" and "Closed"?**
A: Resolved = engineer thinks it's fixed, awaiting your confirmation. Closed = confirmed fixed and completed.

**Q: Can I change the status myself?**
A: No, only engineers can change status. You can comment if status seems wrong.

**Q: How long does "Pending" last?**
A: It should be brief (hours not days). SLA is paused, so respond quickly to resume progress.

**Q: What if I don't respond when status is "Resolved"?**
A: After 48 hours, ticket auto-closes. If issue persists, reopen it.

**Q: Why did my ticket skip "Assigned" status?**
A: Some tickets go directly to "In Progress" if auto-assigned and engineer accepts immediately.

## Tips for Faster Resolution

💡 **Respond to "Pending" Immediately**
This is the #1 cause of delays. Set email notifications to high priority.

💡 **Confirm Resolutions Quickly**
Don't let tickets sit in "Resolved". Test and close or reopen.

💡 **Provide Complete Info Upfront**
Reduce "Pending" cycles by including all details in initial ticket.

💡 **Check Status Regularly**
Don't rely only on email. Check "My Tickets" daily.

💡 **Communicate Changes**
If situation worsens or improves, add a comment immediately.

## Status Best Practices

**For Users:**
✅ Understand what each status means
✅ Take action when status is "Pending"
✅ Confirm or reopen when "Resolved"
✅ Close tickets when truly satisfied
✅ Don't create duplicates while "In Progress"

**For Engineers:**
✅ Update status promptly as work progresses
✅ Add comments explaining status changes
✅ Use "Pending" only when truly waiting for customer
✅ Resolve when solution provided
✅ Follow up if "Pending" too long

      content: `# Adding Comments & Communication

Effective communication speeds up ticket resolution.

## How to Add Comments

**Steps:**
1. Open ticket
2. Go to "Comments" tab
3. Type your message in text box
4. Click "Send" or press Ctrl+Enter

**Comments appear:**
- In chronological order
- With your name and timestamp
- In ticket activity log
- In email notifications

## When to Add Comments

**Add a comment when you:**
- Have new information to share
- Tried a suggested solution
- Issue changed (better/worse)
- Need to provide requested details
- Found a workaround
- Want status update

**Don't comment just to say:**
- "Any updates?" (check status/activity instead)
- "Thank you" after each reply (one at end is fine)
- Duplicate information already in ticket

## What Makes a Good Comment

**✅ Good Comments:**
- Clear and specific
- Include relevant details
- Answer engineer's questions
- Describe what you tried
- Mention results

**Example:**
"I tested the fix you suggested. The error is gone but now the print quality is poor - text appears faded. I tried adjusting printer settings but no change. Using HP LaserJet, Windows 10."

**❌ Poor Comments:**
- "It didn't work"
- "Still broken"
- "???"
- "Please fix ASAP!"

## Internal Notes vs Comments

**Regular Comments:**
- Visible to everyone on ticket
- Sent in email notifications
- Part of ticket history

**Internal Notes (Engineers/Admins only):**
- Visible only to support staff
- For team collaboration
- Document troubleshooting steps
- Not sent to requester

**Users cannot add internal notes.**

## Email Notifications

**When you add comment:**
- Engineer receives email
- Manager receives if watching
- Other participants notified

**When engineer adds comment:**
- You receive email
- Click link to view in system

**Configure:** Profile → Notifications

## @Mentions

**Tag specific people:**
@username to notify someone specific

**Example:**
"@manager This is now affecting 10 users. Please escalate."

**Who can be mentioned:**
- Engineers assigned to ticket
- Managers in department
- Administrators

## Formatting

**Supported formatting:**
- Line breaks (Enter key)
- URLs (auto-clickable)
- Email addresses
- Plain text

**Not supported:**
- Bold, italic, underline
- Lists, tables
- Embedded images (attach separately)
- HTML/Markdown

## Best Practices

**✅ DO:**
- Reply promptly to questions
- Be clear and specific
- Include error codes/messages
- Describe steps you took
- Report results of testing
- Stay professional

**❌ DON'T:**
- Use all caps (SEEMS ANGRY)
- Be rude or demanding
- Include sensitive data
- Post duplicate information
- Spam with multiple comments
- Include screenshots in comment text (attach them)

## Response Times

**Expect response:**
- Critical: Within hours
- High: Same/next business day
- Medium: Within 1-2 business days
- Low: Within 2-3 business days

**If no response and:**
- Status is "Pending" → Add comment
- Status is "In Progress" → Check activity log
- SLA approaching → Comment asking for update

## Editing/Deleting Comments

**Cannot edit:** Once posted, cannot be changed
**Cannot delete:** Only admins can delete

**If mistake:**
Add new comment: "Correction to previous comment: [correct info]"

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I attach files in comments?**
A: Use Attachments tab, then reference in comment.

**Q: Will everyone see my comment?**
A: All ticket participants and support staff, not other users.

**Q: How do I know if engineer read my comment?**
A: Check activity log for "Viewed" events or wait for response.

**Q: Can I communicate outside the ticket?**
A: Keep all communication in ticket for complete record.

    // General Questions
    {
      id: 'faq-create-ticket',
      category: 'general',
      question: 'How do I create a new support ticket?',
      answer: 'Click the "New Ticket" button in the top right corner or navigate to Tickets → Create. Fill in required fields: Subject (be specific!), Description (detailed information), Priority (based on business impact), and Category. You can attach up to 5 files (10MB each). You\'ll receive a confirmation email with your ticket number.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-response-time',
      category: 'general',
      question: 'How long until I get a response?',
      answer: 'Response times depend on priority: Critical (1 hour), High (2 hours), Medium (4 hours), Low (8 hours). Resolution times: Critical (4 hours), High (8 hours), Medium (24 hours), Low (48 hours). Times are based on business hours (Mon-Fri, 9AM-6PM IST).'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-track-ticket',
      category: 'general',
      question: 'How do I track my ticket status?',
      answer: 'Navigate to "My Tickets" in the sidebar to see all your tickets. Each shows current status (Open, Assigned, In Progress, Pending, Resolved, Closed). Click any ticket for detailed view with comments, activity history, and attachments. You also receive email notifications for status changes.'
    },

    // Ticket Management
    {
      id: 'faq-priority',
      category: 'tickets',
      question: 'Which priority should I choose?',
      answer: 'Choose based on business impact: Critical = business stopped (4h SLA), High = major functionality broken (8h SLA), Medium = work affected but manageable (24h SLA), Low = minor issue or request (48h SLA). When in doubt, choose Medium - engineers can adjust if needed.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-pending',
      category: 'tickets',
      question: 'My ticket says "Pending" - what does that mean?',
      answer: 'Pending means the engineer needs information from YOU. Check the latest comment for what\'s needed. Important: SLA timer is PAUSED while in Pending, so your ticket won\'t progress until you respond. Reply as quickly as possible to resume work on your issue.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-escalation',
      category: 'tickets',
      question: 'What is auto-escalation?',
      answer: 'If a ticket isn\'t resolved within its SLA time, it automatically escalates to your department manager. This ensures important tickets don\'t get forgotten. The manager reviews, may reassign, and ensures proper resources are allocated. All stakeholders receive notification emails.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-attachments',
      category: 'tickets',
      question: 'What files can I attach?',
      answer: 'Supported: PDF, Word (DOC/DOCX), Excel (XLS/XLSX), Images (JPG, PNG, GIF), Text files (TXT, LOG, CSV), Archives (ZIP, RAR). Maximum 5 files per ticket, 10MB per file. Executables (.exe, .bat) are blocked for security. Screenshots highly encouraged!'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-reopen',
      category: 'tickets',
      question: 'Can I reopen a closed ticket?',
      answer: 'Yes! If the issue returns within 30 days, open the closed ticket and click "Reopen". Add a comment explaining why. The ticket returns to "Open" status and gets reassigned. After 30 days, create a new ticket and reference the old ticket number.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-multiple-issues',
      category: 'tickets',
      question: 'Can I include multiple issues in one ticket?',
      answer: 'No, create separate tickets for each distinct issue. This allows proper tracking, assignment to specialists, and SLA management. Exception: If issues are clearly related parts of one problem, explain the relationship in the description.'
    },

    // SLA & Escalation
    {
      id: 'faq-sla-calculate',
      category: 'sla',
      question: 'How is SLA time calculated?',
      answer: 'SLA counts only business hours (Mon-Fri, 9AM-6PM IST) by default. Timer pauses outside business hours, on weekends, and when ticket is in "Pending" status. For example, a High priority ticket created Friday 3PM has an 8-hour SLA, which reaches Monday 2PM (3 hours Friday + weekend pause + 5 hours Monday).'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-sla-warning',
      category: 'sla',
      question: 'What happens at 80% SLA?',
      answer: 'When a ticket reaches 80% of its SLA time, warning notifications are sent to the assigned engineer and requester. The ticket displays a yellow warning badge. This gives the team time to resolve before SLA breach or escalate if needed.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-sla-breach',
      category: 'sla',
      question: 'What happens if SLA is breached?',
      answer: 'When resolution time is exceeded: (1) Status changes to "Escalated", (2) Assigned to department manager, (3) Emails sent to engineer, requester, manager, and admins, (4) Breach logged in analytics. The manager reviews and takes corrective action to ensure resolution.'
    },

      id: 'faq-password-reset',
      category: 'account',
      question: 'How do I reset my password?',
      answer: 'On login page, click "Forgot Password". Enter your email address and check inbox for reset link (valid 1 hour). Click link, create new password (min 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, special character). Cannot reuse last 5 passwords. Account locks after 5 failed attempts for 30 minutes.'

      category: 'account',
      question: 'Why is my account locked?',
      answer: 'Accounts lock after 5 failed login attempts for 30 minutes (security protection). Wait 30 minutes or contact administrator to unlock immediately. After unlock, reset password if you\'ve forgotten it. Consider enabling 2FA for better security.'

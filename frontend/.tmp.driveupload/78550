- Updates every 2h
- Workaround if possible
- Auto-escalates if not resolved in 8h

### 🟡 Medium Priority

**SLA:** 4h response, 24h resolution

**Use when:**
- Single user affected

- Updates at key points
- No auto-escalation

## SLA Calculation

**Business Hours (Default):**
- Mon-Fri: 9AM-6PM IST
- Weekends excluded
- Holidays excluded
- Timer pauses outside hours

**Example:**
High priority created Friday 3PM
- Friday 3-6PM = 3 hours
- Weekend = paused
- Monday 9AM-2PM = 5 hours
- Total = 8 hours
- Due: Monday 2PM

**Pending Status:**
Timer PAUSES when waiting for your response!

## Warning System

**80% Warning:**
- Yellow badge on ticket
- Email to engineer
- Dashboard notification

**100% Breach:**
- Red breach indicator
- Status → "Escalated"
- Emails to all stakeholders
- Manager reviews

## Decision Tree

**Is business completely stopped?**
- YES → 🔴 Critical
- NO → Continue

**Are multiple people unable to work?**
- YES → 🟠 High
- NO → Continue

**Is your work significantly impacted?**
- YES → 🟡 Medium
- NO → 🟢 Low

## Best Practices

✅ Choose based on business impact
✅ Be honest about priority
✅ Explain your choice
✅ Update if changes
✅ Trust the process

❌ Don't mark everything Critical
❌ Don't change without reason
❌ Don't create duplicates
❌ Don't ignore "Pending"

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I have multiple Critical tickets?**
A: Yes, but each must truly be critical.

**Q: What if I disagree with priority?**
A: Comment explaining impact. Manager will review.

**Q: Do weekends count?**
A: No (business hours mode). Admin can enable 24/7.

**Q: What if engineer is sick?**
A: Ticket reassigned. SLA continues counting.

      content: `# SLA System Explained

Service Level Agreement (SLA) commitments for response and resolution.

## What is SLA?

Promise to respond and resolve tickets within specific timeframes based on priority.

## SLA Targets

**Critical Priority:**
- Response: 1 hour
- Resolution: 4 hours
- Auto-escalation: Yes

**High Priority:**
- Response: 2 hours
- Resolution: 8 hours
- Auto-escalation: Yes

**Medium Priority:**
- Response: 4 hours
- Resolution: 24 hours
- Auto-escalation: Yes

**Low Priority:**
- Response: 8 hours
- Resolution: 48 hours
- Auto-escalation: No (optional)

## Business Hours

**Default Configuration:**
- Monday - Friday
- 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM IST
- Weekends excluded
- Holidays excluded

**Timer behavior:**
- Pauses at 6PM
- Pauses on weekends
- Pauses on holidays
- Resumes next business day

## SLA Calculation

**Example: High Priority**
Created Friday 3PM
- 3PM-6PM Friday = 3 hours
- Weekend = paused
- 9AM-2PM Monday = 5 hours
- Total = 8 hours
- Due: Monday 2PM

## Warning System

**80% Threshold:**
- Yellow warning badge
- Email notification
- Dashboard alert
- Logged in analytics

**What happens:**
For 8-hour SLA:
- 0-6.4h: Green (safe)
- 6.4-8h: Yellow (warning)
- 8h+: Red (breach)

## SLA Breach

**When resolution exceeded:**
1. Status → "Escalated"
2. Assigned to manager
3. Emails to stakeholders
4. Breach logged
5. Priority may increase

## Pending Status

**Important:** SLA pauses when status is "Pending"

This is fair - engineer cannot resolve without your input!

## Monitoring

**Dashboard shows:**
- SLA percentage
- Time remaining
- Due date
- Color coding

**For Admins:**
- SLA compliance rate
- Average resolution times
- Breach analysis
- Team performance

## Configuration (Admin)

**Settings → SLA:**
- Enable/disable SLA
- Set response times
- Set resolution times
- Configure warning threshold (default 80%)
- Set business hours
- Enable/disable auto-escalation

## Best Practices

**For Users:**
✅ Choose correct priority
✅ Provide complete info
✅ Respond quickly to "Pending"
✅ Confirm resolution promptly

**For Engineers:**
✅ Acknowledge quickly
✅ Update regularly
✅ Use Pending wisely
✅ Escalate if blocked

**For Managers:**
✅ Monitor daily
✅ Review breaches
✅ Adjust if needed
✅ Train team

## Common Questions

**Q: Does SLA count when Pending?**
A: No! Timer pauses until you respond.

**Q: Can I extend SLA?**
A: No directly, but Pending status pauses timer.

**Q: Do weekends count?**
A: Not by default. Admin can enable 24/7.

**Q: What if I miss SLA?**
A: Ticket escalates to manager for review.

Understanding automatic ticket escalation.

## What is Auto-Escalation?

When a ticket exceeds its SLA resolution time, it automatically escalates to department manager.

## When It Triggers

**Enabled for:**
- 🔴 Critical: Always
- 🟠 High: Always
- 🟡 Medium: Always
- 🟢 Low: Optional (admin configurable)

**Condition:**
Resolution SLA time reached (100%)

## What Happens

**Automatic actions:**
1. Status changed to "Escalated"
2. Assigned to department manager
3. Emails sent to:
   - Assigned engineer
   - Ticket requester
   - Department manager
   - System administrators
4. Breach logged in analytics
5. Priority may increase

## Escalation Email

**Recipients receive:**
\`\`\`
Subject: 🔴 SLA BREACH - Ticket #TKT-001234

ALERT: Ticket exceeded SLA target!

Ticket: #TKT-001234
Priority: High
Status: 105% (8.4 / 8.0 hours)
Overdue: 24 minutes

Escalated to management for review.
\`\`\`

## Manager Actions

**Manager can:**
- Review ticket history
- Reassign to different engineer
- Provide additional resources
- Increase priority if needed
- Communicate with requester
- Adjust SLA if justified

## Configuration

**Admin Settings:**
Settings → Ticket → Auto-Escalation

- Enable/disable auto-escalation
- Set escalation threshold (hours)
- Choose escalation status
- Select default assignee

**Per Priority:**
- Enable for Critical
- Enable for High
- Enable for Medium
- Optionally enable for Low

## Escalation Status

**Ticket in "Escalated" status:**
- Highly visible
- Manager notified
- Regular oversight
- Priority handling

**Returns to "In Progress" after:**
- Manager reviews
- Assigns resources
- Issue addressed
- Work resumes

## Why Escalation Happens

**Common reasons:**
- Complex technical issue
- Waiting for external dependency
- Insufficient information provided
- Engineer workload
- Resource constraints

**Not always negative!**
Helps ensure nothing falls through cracks.

## Preventing Escalation

**Engineers can:**
- Provide regular updates
- Set realistic expectations
- Escalate proactively if blocked
- Use Pending status when waiting
- Communicate obstacles

**Users can:**
- Respond quickly to Pending
- Provide complete information
- Test solutions promptly
- Set correct priority

## After Escalation

**Ticket still needs:**
- Your cooperation
- Information when requested
- Testing solutions
- Confirmation when resolved

**Manager ensures:**
- Proper resources allocated
- Obstacles removed
- Communication maintained
- Resolution achieved

## Analytics

**Escalation metrics tracked:**
- Total escalations
- Escalation rate by priority
